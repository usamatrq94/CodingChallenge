# CodingChallenge
## Installing depencencies:
Dependencies for this program can be challenging since this only functions with pandas 0.25.3. Please uninstall pandas and reinstall this version.
```
pip uninstall pandas
pip install pandas==0.25.3
```
Once this done, please install json
```
pip install json==2.0.9
````
Lastly install datetime
```
pip install DateTime
```
## Running file
Once dependencies are installed, please run file using command below:
```
python challenge.py
```
Prompt will ask path to JSON file, in my case its inside same folder, so I would type: ./response.json. The script would print required dictionary onto terminal. 

To understand output of this scripts, please see result.txt file
